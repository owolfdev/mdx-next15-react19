## ‚öõÔ∏è React 19 and Server Components

React 19 brings improved support for Server Components (RSC), and it's fully compatible with `.mdx` files rendered in Server Components. This integration allows for seamless inclusion of MDX content within your server-rendered pages.

## üîÑ Breaking Change in Next.js 15: Async Props

With the release of Next.js 15, there's a significant shift in how certain request-specific data is accessed. APIs such as `params`, `searchParams`, `cookies`, and `headers` are now asynchronous. This means they return Promises and must be awaited, even within Server Components.

### ‚ùó Why This Matters

Previously, in Next.js 14 and earlier, these APIs were synchronous. For example:

```tsx
// Next.js 14
export default function Page({ params }: { params: { slug: string } }) {
  const slug = params.slug;
  return <div>Post: {slug}</div>;
}
```

In Next.js 15, attempting to access `params` synchronously will result in errors because `params` is now a Promise:

```tsx
// ‚ùå This will cause an error in Next.js 15
export default function Page({ params }: { params: { slug: string } }) {
  const slug = params.slug; // Error: Cannot read property 'slug' of undefined
  return <div>Post: {slug}</div>;
}
```

### ‚úÖ Correct Usage in Next.js 15

To adapt to this change, you should await the `params` object:

```tsx
// Next.js 15
export default async function Page({
  params,
}: {
  params: Promise<{ slug: string }>;
}) {
  const { slug } = await params;
  return <div>Post: {slug}</div>;
}
```

This pattern ensures that you're correctly handling the asynchronous nature of these APIs.

## üß© Key Patterns

When working with MDX content and custom components, it's essential to maintain consistent styling and structure. Here's how you can achieve that:

### üñãÔ∏è Using `prose` for Layout

Wrap your MDX content within a styled `<article>` using Tailwind's `prose` class to ensure consistent typography:

```tsx
<article className="prose dark:prose-invert max-w-3xl mx-auto py-10">
  <Content />
</article>
```

This setup provides a clean and readable layout for your content.

### üß± Customizing Components with `useMDXComponents`

To map custom components like `<h1>` or `<Button>`, use the `useMDXComponents` hook:

```tsx
import type { MDXComponents } from "mdx/types";
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";

export function useMDXComponents(
  components: MDXComponents = {}
): MDXComponents {
  return {
    h1: (props) => <h1 className="text-6xl" {...props} />,
    Button: (props) => <Button {...props} />,
    ...components,
  };
}
```

This approach allows you to define consistent styling and behavior for your MDX components across your application.

## üõ†Ô∏è Migration Tips

To facilitate the transition to Next.js 15, consider the following:

- **Codemod Tool**: Utilize the official codemod to automate the migration of synchronous APIs to their asynchronous counterparts:

  ```bash
  npx @next/codemod@canary next-async-request-api .
  ```

- **TypeScript Adjustments**: Update your TypeScript types to reflect the asynchronous nature of these APIs. For example, define `params` as a `Promise`:

  ```tsx
  interface Props {
    params: Promise<{ slug: string }>;
  }
  ```

- **Temporary Workarounds**: While not recommended for long-term use, you can temporarily cast synchronous access to suppress errors:

  ```tsx
  const cookieStore = cookies() as unknown as UnsafeUnwrappedCookies;
  ```

  However, this approach will trigger warnings and should be refactored to use the asynchronous pattern promptly.

By understanding and adapting to these changes, you can ensure that your application remains compatible with Next.js 15 and leverages the latest features and improvements.
